# How to install

Create this clone this repository so that these files end up within the same directory as the rest of Age of Mythology's AI files.  These are located in
```/Age of Mythology/ai2```.
Start up AoM, and start a new game. Go to customize opponents, and select the AI from the dropdown list.

## Naming the AI
1. Go to ```/Age of Mythology/Language/en```
2. Add an numbered entry that is not currently used, (I used 81000). And enter it in with a similar format as the rest of the entries.
3. Make sure this matches the number in the .xml file that defines the AI.
